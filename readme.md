# Basic Information
  This repository is used for storing Python codes of my machine learning assignment.
## asg3
The code in asg3 package is an implementation of Neural Network's **back propagation algorithm**. The process including preprocessing data, training data and making predication of test data. Also, I have implemented **sigmoid**, **tanh** and **relu** activation functions and used three different dataset to compare the performance among these three activation functions.
**Note**: the codes were based on sample code given by Professor Anurag Nagar, especially the starting code for **back propagation** part. Thanks for his work.
